# Declarative Python

A calculation engine for automatically stitching together functions, and walking the dependency tree.

[This python file](https://github.com/hearnderek/DeclarativePython/blob/master/tests/home_economics.py) is the best example for seeing how this can be used to simplify your calculations.

Two major use cases are:
  1. Letting you focus on the individual functions and not the structure of the program.
  2. Writing timeseries projection models which has highly interconnected logic would be a pain to try and structure in a standard program.
